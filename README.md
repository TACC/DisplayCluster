DisplayCluster is a software environment for interactively driving large-scale tiled displays. The software allows users to interactively view media such as high-resolution imagery and video, as well as stream content from remote sources such as laptops / desktops or high-performance remote visualization machines. Many users can simultaneously interact with DisplayCluster with devices such as joysticks or touch-enabled devices such as the iPhone / iPad / iTouch or Android devices. Additionally, a Python scripting interface is provided to automate interaction with DisplayCluster.
