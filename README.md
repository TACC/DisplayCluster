# DisplayCluster

DisplayCluster is a software environment for interactively driving large-scale tiled displays. The software allows users to interactively view media such as high-resolution imagery and video, as well as stream content from remote sources such as laptops / desktops or high-performance remote visualization machines. Many users can simultaneously interact with DisplayCluster with devices such as joysticks or touch-enabled devices such as the iPhone / iPad / iTouch or Android devices. Additionally, a Python scripting interface is provided to automate interaction with DisplayCluster.

DisplayCluster is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/TACC/DisplayCluster. The recommended way to download DisplayCluster is via Git. This will allow you to easily pull updates to the code as they are made. You can download the code with Git by executing the command:
